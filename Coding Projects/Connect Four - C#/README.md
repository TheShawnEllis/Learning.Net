# C# Project - Connect Four

After learning the basics about programming with C#, I wanted to take a crack at an actual project. And because I need a break from reading lesson after lesson. This project was available via [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/). It was written for Python but I created it C# as its just my coding language preference. 

## Goal
The purpose of the project is to create the Connect Four game as a data structure and display it in the console. The goal is to accomplish these tasks:
1. Represent the game of Connect Four as a data structure. 
2. Display the data structure to the user in a way that makes sense.
3. Better understand and practice using logic and data structure in a real way. 

## Requirements
1. Display the board and pieces in the windows console. 
2. Display messages when an invalid move is attempted. For example, 
    - Cannot place a piece in column 0 or 8.
    - Cannot place a piece in a column that is full. 
3. Indicate when a player has won the game after getting 4 pieces of the same type vertically, horizontally, diagonally. 
4. Only 2 players are accespted and their pieces are displayed differently on the board.
5. When a piece is placed in a particular column, it should be placed in the correct row as if it fell to the appropriate spot. 

## Acceptance Criteria 
1. Represent a game of Connect Four as a data structure. You should be able to edit the data structure directly to add pieces to the board. A traditional Connect Four board is 7 columns and 6 rows.
2. Display the connect four board to your users. This will involve parsing your data structure to print out the correct pieces in the correct location.
