## Algorithms 
### What is an algorithm?

A well-definied sequential process or instructions that describe how to perform a task or solve a problem.

### Characteristics of Algorithms 
All algorithms have several characteristics that are used to describe them:
1. **Space Complexity:** describes how much memory and storage space the algorithm needs to complete the work.
2. **Time Complexity:** describes how efficient the algorithm is relative to the size of the input it is given to work on
3. **Inputs and Outputs:** describes the number of input and output values worked on to produce the desired result. 
4. **Classification:** describes the classification or how the algorithm operates. Some examples are:
   - Recursive or Iteration
   - Procedural or Declarative
   - Serial, Parallel, or Distributed
   - Deterministic or Non-Deterministic  
   - Exact or Approximate

### Common Types of Algorithms
**Search Algorithms** - have the purpose of finding specific data in a structure. For example a substring within a string.

**Sorting Algorithms** - purpose of taking a dataset and applying a sorting order to it.

**Computational Algorithms** - purpose of taking one set of data to derive another set of data from it. For example, calculating prime of the given number. 

**Collection Algorithms** - involve manipulating or navigating among sets of data that are stored within a particular structure. For example, counting items or filtering in a dataset.
